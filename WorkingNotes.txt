Fight.py:
 -- edit to not include any striking stats, can sum from rounds

 Round.py:
 -- edit to include all stats, all stats are listed
    but not all are included in save() method.

CreateDatabase.py:
 -- edit Fight table to not include striking stats

Still need to create actual webscraper. Can salvage bits of code
from Fighter.py and FightDetails.py. Will need to refactor though,
pretty messy code.
