Still need to create actual webscraper. Can salvage bits of code
from Fighter.py and FightDetails.py. Will need to refactor though,
pretty messy code.

improve error handling

Find a way to speed the process up, takes awfully long. Parallelizing
the code wasn't working.

Scraper for fight data and round data, will be done in one script.
